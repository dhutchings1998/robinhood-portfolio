# Robinhood Portfolio Analytics [In Progress]

## Overview
I am building a custom made portfolio analytics dashboard for my Robinhood portfolio using Streamlit. The goal is to showcase important portfolio information that is outside the scope of the Robinhood app.
In order to protect my Robinhood account information, I am waiting to make the dashboard public until I can do so securely.

## To-Do
* Update my alpha and beta calculations to reflect a more recent value
* Include a rolling alpha and beta chart
* Add a news section that reports news stories about my stocks
* Feature that automatically rebalances my portfolio every month
